                <p>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a new
                    son and a year’s
                    appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far beyond the
                    world of known
                    physics.</p>

                <p>He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been
                    created in the Big
                    Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch
                    in the presumed
                    course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a
                    repulsive force, causing
                    the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.</p>


                <p>If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to
                    pole and not like a
                    jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities.
                    Those particles were
                    not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.</p>
                <p>“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around it.
                </p>
                <p>On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning
                    of the Big Bang,
                    and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.

                    Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic time with telescopes at the
                    South Pole,
                    a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics
                    detected
                    ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called gravitational waves — the signature of a universe
                    being
                    wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a
                    second old.
                    They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say,
                    that Dr.
                    Guth was correct.

                    Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth,
                    wondered whether it could ever be proved.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent
                    discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open
                    vast realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.
                </p>
                <p>Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years
                    in space with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a
                    larger cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our
                    own universe there might be an endless number of other universes bubbling into frothy
                    eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.

                    <strong>‘As Big as It Gets’</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies
                    forever beyond the reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity
                    itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of gravitational waves, which,
                    according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity, should ruffle space-time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of the
                    team, said,
                    “This is huge, as big as it gets.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded in
                    gravitational waves.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that
                    permeates space and
                    preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of the
                    sun.
                </p>
                <p>Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background Imaging of
                    Cosmic Extragalactic
                    Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for Astrophysics here on
                    Monday and in a set
                    of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.

                            <strong>INFLATION</strong> solves this problem. The theory proposes that, less than a
                            trillionth of a second after the Big Bang, the universe expanded faster than the speed of
                            light. Tiny ripples in the violently expanding energy field eventually grew into the

                    Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had not expected such a definite

                    The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ worth of observations and analysis.
                    Eschewing email for
                    fear of a leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a select few, meeting with Dr.

                    inflation, known as chaotic inflation, in 1983, was about to go on
                    vacation in the Caribbean last week when Chao-Lin Kuo, a Stanford colleague and a member of Dr.
                    Kovac’s team, knocked on his door with a bottle of Champagne to
                    tell him the news.

                    Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had ordered anything.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was a delivery but we did not think
                    that we ordered anything, but I simply forgot that actually I did order it, 30 years ago,” Dr. Linde
                    wrote in an email.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he was still hyperventilating.
                    “Having news like this is the best way of spoiling a vacation,” he said.

                    By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that inflation had been seen and news
                    spread, astrophysicists responded with a mixture of jubilation and caution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I think that if this stays true, it will
                    go down as one of the greatest discoveries in the history of science.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor and head of a competing project
                    called the South Pole Telescope, pronounced himself deeply impressed. “I think the results are
                    beautiful and very convincing,” he said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to inflation that posits the clash of a pair
                    of universes as the cause of genesis, said that if true, the Bicep result would eliminate his model,
                    but he expressed reservations about inflation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the need for confirmation, noting
                    that the new results exceeded earlier estimates based on temperature maps of the cosmic background
                    by the European Space Agency’s Planck satellite and other assumptions about the universe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and down,” Dr. Krauss said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft will report its own findings this
                    year. At least a dozen other teams are trying similar measurements from balloons, mountaintops and
                    space.

                    Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the cosmic microwaves, which were
                    discovered accidentally by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won the
                    Nobel Prize.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these waves. He is one of four leaders
                    of Bicep, which has operated a series of increasingly sensitive radio telescopes at the South Pole,
                    where the thin, dry air creates ideal observing conditions. The others are Clement Pryke of the
                    University of Minnesota, Jamie Bock of the California Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of
                    Stanford.
                </p>

                <p>
                    “The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be on the ground,” Dr. Kovac said. He
                    has been there 23 times, he said, wintering over in 1994. “I’ve been hooked ever since,” he said.

                    In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave radiation was polarized, meaning
                    the light waves had a slight preference to vibrate in one direction rather than another.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the gravitational waves from inflation. Such
                    waves, squeezing space in one direction and stretching it in another as they go by, would twist the
                    direction of polarization of the microwaves, theorists said. As a result, maps of the polarization
                    in the sky should have little arrows going in spirals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small differences in the temperature of
                    the microwaves. The group’s telescope, Bicep2, is basically a giant superconducting thermometer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “We had no expectations what we would see,” Dr. Kovac said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they spent a year burning up time on a
                    Harvard supercomputer, making sure they had things right and worrying that competitors might beat
                    them to the breakthrough.

                        A Special Time
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that physicists like Dr. Guth, staying up late in
                    his Palo Alto house 35 years ago, suspected was a special break point in the evolution of the
                    universe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today: gravity, electromagnetism, and strong
                    and weak nuclear forces. But they have long suspected that those are simply different manifestations
                    of a single unified force that ruled the universe in its earliest, hottest moments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a fall from grace, like some old folk
                    mythology of gods or brothers falling out with each other. The laws of physics evolved, with one
                    force after another splitting away.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That was where Dr. Guth came in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as the temperature falls below 32
                    degrees, until it is disturbed, at which point it will rapidly freeze, releasing latent heat.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Similarly, the universe could “supercool” and stay in a unified state too long. In that case, space
                    itself would become imbued with a mysterious latent energy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Inserted into Einstein’s equations, the latent energy would act as a kind of antigravity, and the
                    universe would blow itself up. Since it was space itself supplying the repulsive force, the more
                    space was created, the harder it pushed apart.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size at least a trillion trillionfold — from
                    a submicroscopic speck of primordial energy to the size of a grapefruit — in less than a cosmic
                    eye-blink.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into ordinary particles and radiation. All of
                    normal cosmic history was still ahead, resulting in today’s observable universe, a patch of sky and
                    stars billions of light-years across. “It’s often said that there is no such thing as a free lunch,”
                    Dr. Guth likes to say, “but the universe might be the ultimate free lunch.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models resulting from Dr. Guth’s original vision
                    suggest that inflation, once started, is eternal. Even as our own universe settled down to a
                    comfortable homey expansion, the rest of the cosmos will continue blowing up, spinning off other
                    bubbles endlessly, a concept known as the multiverse.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund, but do not bother asking about going any
                    deeper into the past.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We might never know what happened before inflation, at the very beginning, because inflation erases
                    everything that came before it. All the chaos and randomness of the primordial moment are swept
                    away, forever out of our view.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “If you trace your cosmic roots,” said Abraham Loeb, a Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer who was not
                    part of the team, “you wind up at inflation.”
