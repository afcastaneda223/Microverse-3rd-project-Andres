                <p>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a new
                    son and a year’s
                    appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far beyond the
                    world of known
                    physics.</p>

                <p>He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been
                    created in the Big
                    Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch
                    in the presumed
                    course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a
                    repulsive force, causing
                    the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.</p>


                <p>If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to
                    pole and not like a
                    jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities.
                    Those particles were
                    not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.</p>
                <p>“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around it.
                </p>
                <p>On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning
                    of the Big Bang,
                    and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.

                    Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic time with telescopes at the
                    South Pole,
                    a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics
                    detected
                    ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called gravitational waves — the signature of a universe
                    being
                    wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a
                    second old.
                    They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say,
                    that Dr.
                    Guth was correct.

                    Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth, 
                    wondered whether it could ever be proved.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent 
                    discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open 
                    vast realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.
                </p>
                <p>Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years 
                    in space with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a 
                    larger cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our 
                    own universe there might be an endless number of other universes bubbling into frothy 
                    eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.

                    <strong>‘As Big as It Gets’</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies 
                    forever beyond the reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity 
                    itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of gravitational waves, which, 
                    according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity, should ruffle space-time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of the team, said, 
                    “This is huge, as big as it gets.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that permeates space and 
                    preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of the sun.
                </p>
                <p>Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic 
                    Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set 
                    of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.
